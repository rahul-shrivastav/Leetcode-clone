## Tech Stack

- ` Next.js ` : A React-based framework for building server-rendered and static web applications, offering features like routing, API handling, and optimized performance.
- ` React.js ` : A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
- ` Node.js `: A server-side runtime that allows running JavaScript on the backend.
- `MongoDB ` : A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
- `Tailwind-CSS` : A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly by composing classes directly in HTML.
- `Redis` : An in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. I used it as a message queue to efficiently manage and process background tasks.

## Workflow

- User submits code from the frontend (React or similar).

- API Service (Flask + Gunicorn) accepts the submission, stores metadata in MongoDB (status = pending), and pushes the job into Redis queue.

- Worker Service (Flask background service with thread pool) pulls jobs from Redis, executes user code safely (via subprocess or Docker depending on environment), and updates the MongoDB record with results.

- Frontend polls MongoDB via the API to check if submission results are available (status = executed).

## Getting Started

</div>

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahul-shrivastav/Leetcode-clone.git
```


### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Setup Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file
```bash
MONGO_DB_URI  
AUTH_SECRET  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID  
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  
NODE_ENV
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXTAUTH_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBMIT_CODE_API2  
```
A sample .evn file is also provided in the repository.

### 4. Run Dev server Locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
### 4. Setup the python code execution server locally 
Follow the readme.md file in the given repo to setup locally :

[![GitHub Repo](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Visit%20Repo-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/rahul-shrivastav/Python-Code-Execution-Server)                                     

<br>

After setting up python server locally , open port `3000` on your `localhost` with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
