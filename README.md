## Tech Stack

-   `Next.js` : A React-based framework for building server-rendered and static web applications, offering features like routing, API handling, and optimized performance.
-   `React.js` : A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
-   `Node.js`: A server-side runtime that allows running JavaScript on the backend.
-   `MongoDB ` : A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
-   `Tailwind-CSS` : A utility-first CSS framework for building custom, responsive designs quickly by composing classes directly in HTML.
-   `Redis` : An in-memory data structure store commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. I used it as a message queue to efficiently manage and process background tasks.

## Workflow

-   User submits code from the frontend (React or similar).

-   API Service (Flask + Gunicorn) accepts the submission, stores metadata in MongoDB (status = pending), and pushes the job into Redis queue.

-   Worker Service (Flask background service with thread pool) pulls jobs from Redis, executes user code safely (via subprocess or Docker depending on environment), and updates the MongoDB record with results.

-   Frontend polls MongoDB via the API to check if submission results are available (status = executed).

## Getting Started

</div>

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahul-shrivastav/Leetcode-clone.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ../backend/api_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../execution_service
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

```bash
MONGO_DB_URI=
AUTH_SECRET =
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID =
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET =

NEXTAUTH_URL= http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_NEXTAUTH_URL= http://localhost:3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBMIT_CODE_API= http://127.0.0.1:5000
SUBMIT_CODE_API= http://127.0.0.1:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKER_URL = http://127.0.0.1:5001
WORKER_URL = http://127.0.0.1:5001
REDIS_URL = redis://localhost:6379
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIS_URL = redis://localhost:6379
```

A sample .evn file is also provided in the repository.

### 4. Run Dev server Locally

First, run the frontend and backend development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev

```

and locate to backend

```bash
cd api_service
python app.py
cd ../execution_service
python worker.py
```
